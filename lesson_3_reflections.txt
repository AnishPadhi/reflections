When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When there are major updates in a project whih is ready to be shared in the public 
	domain, also sometimes its a better practice to just keep saving it in the github 
	server so that, in an unforeseen circumstance of system crash and all files on the
	system getting removed you still have a copy in the cloud server of github.
