When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When there are major updates in a project whih is ready to be shared in the public 
    domain, also sometimes its a better practice to just keep saving it in the github 
    server so that, in an unforeseen circumstance of system crash and all files on the
    system getting removed you still have a copy in the cloud server of github.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
